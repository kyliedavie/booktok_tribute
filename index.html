            <h2>The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo <span class="small"> <a href="https://taylorjenkinsreid.com/about/"> by Taylor Jenkins Reid </a> </span></h2>
            <h3>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; 4.47 stars on Goodreads </h3>
            <p>Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?</p>

            <p>Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jump start her career. </p>
                
            <p>Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.</p>

                <p> This book literally changed the way I saw the way women live their lives. Evelyn Hugo, while completely fictional and non-existent, represented so many women in ways we would rather not admit to even ourselves. This book helped show how much of our lives we live for other people; how many decisions we make to make other people feel comfortable; how many things we deny because we are afraid of what people will think; how much time we waste without the people we love because society can’t accept us for who we are. </p>

                <p>This book gave a new perspective on love: that it is dangerous and risky and something that we have to fight for. I really started thinking about how fortunate we are to grow up in a more forgiving time period where gender and sexuality is fluid and moving. Just ten years earlier and loving someone of the same sex was terrifying and threatening. And there is something so woefully romantic about the fact that there were people who braved that atmosphere and loved anyway and paved the path for me and so many others. </p>

            <h2>The Song of Achilles <span class="small"> <a href="http://madelinemiller.com/the-author/">by Madeline Miller </a> </span></h2>
            <h3>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; 4.38 stars on Goodreeds</h3>
            <p>Achilles, "the best of all the Greeks," son of the cruel sea goddess Thetis and the legendary king Peleus, is strong, swift, and beautiful, irresistible to all who meet him. Patroclus is an awkward young prince, exiled from his homeland after an act of shocking violence. Brought together by chance, they forge an inseparable bond, despite risking the gods' wrath.</p>

            <p>They are trained by the centaur Chiron in the arts of war and medicine, but when word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, all the heroes of Greece are called upon to lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the cruel Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice.</p>

                <p>Wow, we all know the story of the famous Greek legends and their valiantry but to think that no one knows the epic tale of Achilles and Patroclus? That’s a disappointment. </p>

                   <p> So often the tales of history are sugar coated and romanticized for the sake of happy reviews and 5 stars, but Madeline Miller said fuck that and wrote it how it was: disastrous and beautiful; bloody and delicate; fearful and fascinating. The Song of Achilles is a tale about the fall of Troy, but really, it’s a story of passion, sacrifice, desperation, pride, and the consequences of caring too little and loving too much. </p>
                        
                    <p>Miller beautifully recreated the legends we all dream of witnessing and brought them to life in a different way than most authors. The hero Achilles is constantly represented as a stone cold, callous, brutal warrior. And while he was all of these things, Patroclus cuts through the armor of the hero and reveals his tenderness, his insecurity, his honesty and need for validation. Through the passionate, and borderline destructive, love of these two heros, we see that when desperate love exists, disaster often follows. </p>

            <h2>Untamed <span class="small"> <a href="https://momastery.com/blog/about-glennon/"> by Glennon Doyle </a></span></h2>
            <h3> &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; 4.01 stars on Goodreads</h3>
            <p>Soulful and uproarious, forceful and tender, Untamed is both an intimate memoir and a galvanizing wake-up call. It is the story of how one woman learned that a responsible mother is not one who slowly dies for her children, but one who shows them how to fully live. It is the story of navigating divorce, forming a new blended family, and discovering that the brokenness or wholeness of a family depends not on its structure but on each member’s ability to bring her full self to the table. And it is the story of how each of us can begin to trust ourselves enough to set boundaries, make peace with our bodies, honor our anger and heartbreak, and unleash our truest, wildest instincts so that we become women who can finally look at ourselves and say: There She Is.</p>

                <p>To the book that literally made me a feminist, thank you. We are motherfuckin cheetas and I wouldn’t be who I am without you.</p>

                   <p> I read this book about three years ago and still to this day I pick it up, read a random chapter, and it resonates with me all over again. I genuinely think this book should be put into the high school curriculum and taught to all teenagers. While it is mostly geared towards empowering women, men can learn from it too. It touches on the most important gender norms of both sexes. It speaks about toxic masculinity and how it is ruining the men around us, and talks about how we are devaluing women and teaching them to be small and weak.</p>
                        
                    <p>Glennon Doyle puts her most vulnerable self into this book and encourages us to learn from her mistakes and take her with us through the journey of life. With everything out on the table, she delivers stories that are truly gut-wrenching, inspiring, and ultimately uplifting. After battling alcoholism, bulimia, infidelity, and struggling with her own sexuality, she found comfort first in her love of self, and then in the love of woman. Each chapter holds its own message and makes you think just a little bit more than the previous one. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>“This life is mine alone. So I have stopped asking people for directions to places they’ve never been.”</li>
                        <li>“When women lose themselves, the world loses its way. We do not need more selfless women. What we need right now is more women who have detoxed themselves so completely from the world's expectations that they are full of nothing but themselves. What we need are women who are full of themselves. A woman who is full of herself knows and trusts herself enough to say and do what must be done. She lets the rest burn.”</li>
                        <li>“What is better: uncomfortable truth or comfortable lies? Every truth is a kindness, even if it makes others uncomfortable. Every untruth is an unkindness, even if it makes others comfortable.”</li>

            <h2>Archer's Voice <span class="small"> <a href="https://miasheridan.com/about/">by Mia Sheridan </a></span></h2>
            <h3>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; 4.33 stars on Goodreads</h3>
            <p>When Bree Prescott arrives in the sleepy, lakeside town of Pelion, Maine, she hopes against hope that this is the place where she will finally find the peace she so desperately seeks. On her first day there, her life collides with Archer Hale, an isolated man who holds a secret agony of his own. A man no one else sees.

            <p>Archer's Voice is the story of a woman chained to the memory of one horrifying night and the man whose love is the key to her freedom. It is the story of a silent man who lives with an excruciating wound and the woman who helps him find his voice. It is the story of suffering, fate, and the transformative power of love.</p>

                <p>Mia Sheridan does Colleen Hoover better than Colleen Hoover. </p>

                <p> In my honest opinion, and I might break the internet with this one, Colleen Hoover books are alright. They’re not necessarily bad, but I definitely don’t find them great. But Archer’s Voice gave the cheesy story-line, spicy scenes and gut wrenching backstory with an elegance that Colleen Hoover just can’t. I found the majority of her books to be predictable and just downright cringy. However, Archer’s Voice was beautifully written with just the right amount of spice and pulling at the heartstrings. </p>
                        
                <p>***Spoilers Ahead***</p>

                <p>I think the lesson behind this book is what made it so good: everyone has a voice and deserves to be heard. I remember when I first started reading this book I kept waiting for Archer to reveal that he actually could speak and was just shy, but that never happened. Mia Sheridan's ability to write so eloquently and convey strong emotions and vivid imagery was absolutely captivating. This was a brilliant tale of coming back from a traumatic experience and finding solace in another person. Archer and Bree were both searching for someone to understand their struggles and they found each other just when they needed them most. </p>

                    <li>““Bad things don't happen to people because they deserve for them to happen. It just doesn't work that way. It's just… life. And no matter who we are, we have to take the hand we're dealt, crappy though it may be, and try our very best to move forward anyway, to love anyway, to have hope anyway… to have faith that there's a purpose to the journey we're on.”</li>
                    <li>“I realized that people's reactions had more to do with them, more to do with who they were, than anything about me”</li>
